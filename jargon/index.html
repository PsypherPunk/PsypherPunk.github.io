    <h2 id="jargon-do-you-grok-it">Jargon, do you grok it?</h2>
<p>I recently had a weird conversation on Teams (yes, we use Microsoft
Teams at work; don't judge us); triggered by a question in a recent
Postman user-survey, it prompted a discussion around &quot;unique terminology&quot;
in sofware development and to what degree each of us had been exposed.</p>
<p>Not long after, I ended up referencing a
<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/P/phase-of-the-moon.html"><em>phase of the moon</em></a>
issue with a colleague, with regard to some particularly erratic
behaviour we were seeing.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but feel a little nostalgic, harkening back as it did
to reading the Jargon File <em>back in the day</em>. Back at University, I
used to have a copy of <em>The New Hacker's Dictionary</em> on my shelf and
would pore over its entries, hoping some profound knowledge would rub
off in some weird form of osmosis twixt me and the hackers of yore.
Spoilers: it didn't.</p>
<p>&quot;Jargon&quot; of any kind has an important place, whether in a culture or a
profession, insofar as it invariably carries a loaded and precise
meaning to those &quot;in the know&quot;. It's that last part that arguably has
most significance, as not only is the meaning important but
also the weird sociological distinctionâ€”there's something innately
exclusionist about its use.</p>
<p>Sociological musings aside, I was on a nostalgia trip.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-kiss-an-elephant-on-the-lips-today"><em>&quot;Don't kiss an elephant on the lips today.&quot;</em></h2>
<p>Everyone remembers <code>fortune</code>, right?</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#bf616a;">$</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;"> fortune
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">A</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;"> few hours grace before the madness begins again.
</span></code></pre>
<p>Way back when I first used Linux (over 20 years ago now; Red Hat,
before it gained its <em>Enterprise</em> suffix) something akin to the above
would appear every time I logged in. It was strange, utterly alien to
everything I'd know before, and I <em>loved it</em>.</p>
<p>So I wanted to throw together something that would spit out entries
from the Jargon File, in the style of
<a href="https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod"><code>fortune</code></a> and its ilk.</p>
<p>Using <em>Rust</em>, natch.</p>
<h2 id="the-jargon-file">The Jargon File</h2>
<p>The most recent version which can claim provenance from
the original
<a href="https://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-4.4.7.dos.txt">Jargon File</a>
is now sadly defunct. Thanks, however, to the wonderful folks at the
Internet Archive, it's been preserved
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827121341/http://cosman246.com/jargon.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Although the content is more than worth your time, the HTML isn't
particularly well structured, making parsing difficult.</p>
<p>What to do? Python and Beautiful Soup? Too much code.</p>
<p>Use <code>sed</code> to strip the HTML tags? Well, that works but checking for
multi-line tags feels like too much effort.</p>
<p>Use <code>lynx</code> to dump the text? Everyone has a headless browser, right?</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#bf616a;">lynx </span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">\
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">    --dump </span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">\
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">    --width</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;"> 120 \
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">    --nonumbers </span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">\
    ${</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">INTERNET_ARCHIVE_URL</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">} &gt; jargon.txt
</span></code></pre>
<p>That gives us a nice, parsed version of the original page with which to
begin.</p>
<p>A while ago, after getting rather bored, having cranked out a dozen
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object">POJOs</a> for a
project, I ended up outsourcing my efforts to a Python script. With a
handful of lines and some configuration, I had the whole lot completed
in a fraction of the time.</p>
<p>Drawing on that earlier <del>laziness</del> inspiration, I tried the same
here. Having defined a simple <code>struct</code> to hold each entry:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#b48ead;">pub struct </span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">Jargon {
    </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">pub </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">term</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">: &amp;</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">&#39;static str</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">,
    </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">pub </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">definition</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">: &amp;</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">&#39;static str</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">,
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>â€¦I wrote some Python to parse the <code>jargon.txt</code> file and generate
hard-coded instances for each entry.</p>
<p>However, wanting to dig a little deeper into how Rust might enable me
to do this entirely in its own space, I started looking at
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html">Build Scripts</a>.</p>
<p>The initial attempt is ugly but you can see it
<a href="https://github.com/PsypherPunk/jargon-rs/tree/0.1.0">here</a>. The build
script effectively serves the same purpose as the Python code,
generating the appropriate <code>lib.rs</code> file at compile time.</p>
<p>It's inelegant at best and (again with the nostalgia) reminds me of the
large, unstructured blocks of code I used to churn out when I was
first thumbing through <em>The New Hacker's Dictionary</em>.</p>
<p>There's further work needed, certainly on getting to grips with the
code, but also the entire <code>lynx</code> step can likely be droppedâ€”I'd
initially been wary of include the Jargon File's contents in the repo.
itself, failing to note that second paragraph where it's explicity
stated that it <em>&quot;is in the public domain&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>Maybe it'll even get published as a <a href="https://crates.io/"><em>crate</em></a>
(though it took me long enough to publish anything on PyPI, maybe
that can wait a little longer.)</p>
<h2 id="jargon"><code>jargon</code></h2>
<p>That's it. Clone the repo. and <code>cargo run --release</code>. It'll randomly
select one of the entries at runtime and print it, Ã  la <code>fortune</code>.</p>
<p>If you're also joining me on my nostalgia trip, you could even use
<code>cowsay</code>:</p>
