      <blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Has anyone ever participated in a Capture-the-flag style hacking event?
Does anyone fancy trying one?&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, fairly innocuously, began what turned out to be a pretty interesting event.</p>
<p>We recently ran a Capture the Flag (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->CTF<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)
event at my workplace. For anyone unfamiliar with the concept (which, in all
fairness, was the position of many of the participants), there are a
<a href="https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/">few variants</a> of CTF events but the essential
premise is this: teams compete to find specific, intended vulnerabilities in a
software application. Once found, the application presents the team with a code
(the eponymous &ldquo;flag&rdquo;) which gains the team points. At the end of the
competition, the team with the most points wins. Simple, no?</p>
<p>The application in this instance was the
<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project">OWASP Juice Shop</a>,
a truly sublime piece of work, created by
<a href="https://twitter.com/bkimminich">Bjoern Kimminich</a>. The site presents itself as
a <em>&ldquo;a small online shop which sells - surprise! - fruit &amp; vegetable juice and
associated products&rdquo;</em>. In reality, it&rsquo;s an immensely well-crafted presentation
of potential (and all-too-real) security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><img src="/img/juice-shop.png" alt="OWASP Juice Shop"></p>
<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>
<p>Getting an instance of the Juice Shop up and running is straightforward
enoughâ€”it&rsquo;s easily deployable as a
<a href="https://elements.heroku.com/buttons/bkimminich/juice-shop">Heroku Element</a>,
or you can get it running with Docker in a single command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop
</code></pre></div><p>That&rsquo;ll give you a fully-functioning version of the Juice Shop at which you can
hack away to your heart&rsquo;s content. However, I wanted to keep the competition
private and although Heroku does allow for restricting access, it comes at a
cost. No, I was going to run this myselfâ€¦</p>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>Although the documentation is available for
<a href="https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/">free</a> on the
web, it&rsquo;s also available for purchase on
<a href="https://leanpub.com/juice-shop">Leanpub</a>. In the hope that some of the money
makes it back to the contributors, I&rsquo;d highly recommend acquiring a copy.</p>
<p>By default, the application effectively runs in a &ldquo;standalone&rdquo; mode, allowing
users to find the various vulnerabilities but can also be run in CTF mode,
presenting unique CTF flag codes upon discovery, again well
<a href="https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/part1/ctf.html">documented</a>.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the competition, there are two components: the Juice Shop
itself (one per team) plus a scoreboard.</p>
<p>The scoreboard serves a multitude of purposes: handling registrations for each
of the users (and their corresponding teams), offering a centralised point in
which flags can be collated and tracked and, most importantly, presenting the
scores for everyone to see.</p>
<p>There are two main scoreboards covered in the documentation:
<a href="https://ctfd.io/about/">CTFd</a> and Facebook&rsquo;s
<a href="https://github.com/facebook/fbctf">fbctf</a>.</p>
<p>Spoilers: I opted for the former. The latter, although it has a nice aesthetic,
presented far too many problems during setup while the former &ldquo;just worked&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So my plan was this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;d run a single virtual machine for the whole competition.</li>
<li>Each instance of the Juice Shop would have its own unique hostname.</li>
<li>The CTFd instance would run alongside them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Easy enough, right?</p>
<h2 id="the-virtual-machine">The Virtual Machine</h2>
<p>I opted for a Virtual Machine hosted by DigitalOcean (sorry, a
<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/"><em>droplet</em></a>)
running <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/">Debian Stretch</a>
(because <em>Debian</em>) and decided to run everything using Docker (because
<em>DevOps</em>).</p>
<p>For the purposes of locking the machine down during setup, I used
<a href="https://code.launchpad.net/ufw"><em>Uncomplicated Firewall</em></a> to restrict access
from anywhere except the office:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow from <span style="color:#e6db74">${</span>OFFICE_IP<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span> to ssh
</code></pre></div><h2 id="the-juice-shops">The Juice Shop(s)</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the Juice Shop does allow for
<a href="https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/part1/customization.html">customisation</a>â€”everything
from logos to shop items and such. However, frankly I didn&rsquo;t want to detract
from the beauty of the thingâ€”it really is a marvel, the level of effort which
has been applied to the project.</p>
<p>In order to generate unique keys for each of the flags (lest some enterprising
participant use a code they happened upon elsewhereâ€¦) we first generated a
random string:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">CTF_KEY<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;a-zA-Z0-9&#39;</span> | fold -w <span style="color:#ae81ff">32</span> | head -n 1<span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, for each instance of the Juice Shop that we needed (two, in our case),
we launch a Docker container for each:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">docker run -d <span style="color:#ae81ff">\
</span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>    --name juice-shop-ctf <span style="color:#ae81ff">\
</span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>    --env <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;CTF_KEY=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">${</span>CTF_KEY<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">\
</span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>    --env <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;NODE_ENV=ctf&#34;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">\
</span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>    --publish <span style="color:#e6db74">${</span>JUICE_SHOP_PORT<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span>:3000 <span style="color:#ae81ff">\
</span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>    bkimminich/juice-shop
</code></pre></div><p>Note that each ran on a different port on the host (specified via
<code>JUICE_SHOP_PORT</code> above) and we passed in the <code>CTF_KEY</code> value generated earlier.</p>
<h2 id="ctfd">CTFd</h2>
<p>Running an instance of the scoreboard was, thankfully, not much more difficult:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd.git
cd CTFd/
</code></pre></div><p>Once we had a copy of the codebase there was only one further step before
launchingâ€”including the random key we generated earlier. In the cloned folder,
we need to edit the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file to include a <code>SECRET_KEY</code> value:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">version: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;2&#39;</span>

services:
  ctfd:
    â€¦
    environment:
      - SECRET_KEY<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">${</span>CTF_KEY<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span>
      â€¦
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>CTF_KEY</code> above was replaced with the <em>actual</em> generated value. Once that
single line was added, the instance was ready to launch.</p>
<p>As hinted in the above step, CTFd uses
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/"><code>docker-compose</code></a> to handle the various
services which are needed, the installation instructions for which are nicely
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">straightforward</a>. Once installedâ€¦</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">docker-compose up -d
</code></pre></div><h2 id="dns">DNS</h2>
<p>With two Juice Shop instances and a scoreboard running, it was time to make
them accessible.</p>
<p>For reference, we had two teams: <em>Anomynoush</em> (an acknowledgement of the noted
hacktivist collective and a visiting dignitary) and <em>H4ck t3h P14n3t!</em> (which,
if you don&rsquo;t get the reference: <em>shame on you!</em>). So we would need three
subdomains:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>anomynoush.example.com</code></li>
<li><code>h4ckt3hp14n3t.example.com</code></li>
<li><code>ctfd.example.com</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Creating the various subdomains for each of the services was a matter of
creating DNS <em>A records</em>â€”the exact steps for this will vary depending on with
whom your domain is registered. In this instance, the domain was registered
with <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> and their
<a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9776/2237/how-to-create-a-subdomain-for-my-domain">documentation</a>
is decent enough, albeit specific to their interface.</p>
<h2 id="https">HTTPS</h2>
<p>Naturally we&rsquo;re going to make everything accessible over HTTPS and that means
<em>certificates</em>. And frankly, few services have done more for the proliferation
of HTTPS than <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"><em>Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</em></a>.</p>
<p>In this case, I used <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/"><em>Certbot</em></a> to facilitate the
creation of each certificate. There are a few different methods and various
plugins but the steps that worked for me were:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo apt install certbot python-certbot-nginx
sudo ufw allow <span style="color:#ae81ff">80</span>
sudo certbot --nginx -d <span style="color:#e6db74">${</span>CTF_HOST<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span>
sudo ufw delete allow <span style="color:#ae81ff">80</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Yes, it involved temporarily opening up port 80 in the firewall, but it
<em>worked</em>. Once that was repeated for each of the hostnames (represented by
<code>CTF_HOST</code> above), I just needed something to route traffic to the containers.</p>
<h2 id="nginx">NGINX</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nginx.com/">NGINX</a> is <em>awesome</em>. In this case, it&rsquo;s providing a
reverse-proxy, handling routing of incoming requests to the corresponding
containers.</p>
<p>Again, DigitalOcean have excellent
<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-16-04">documentation</a>
on the setup but here&rsquo;s the setup for one of the Juice Shop instances:</p>
<pre><code>server {
    server_name h4ckt3hp14n3t.example.com;
    listen 443 ssl http2;

    }

</code></pre><p>The important things to note here are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>server_name</code>: this is the hostname designated in the <a href="#dns">DNS</a> section
earlier.</li>
<li><code>proxy_pass</code>: this will always be <code>http://localhost</code> but the port will be the
<code>JUICE_SHOP_PORT</code> value specified in the <a href="#the-juice-shop-s">Juice Shop(s)</a>
section earlier.</li>
<li><code>ssl_certificate</code> and <code>ssl_certificate_key</code> will be the values of the files
created as part of the <a href="#https">HTTPS</a> section earlier.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once each of the sites are configured as per the above, the final step is to
tell the firewall to allow incoming connections:</p>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="setting-up-the-scoreboard">Setting Up the Scoreboard</h2>
<h3 id="importing-the-flags">Importing the Flags</h3>
<p>The first stage in setting up the CTFd instance is adding the various flags
from the Juice Shop. Thankfully, there&rsquo;s a nice tool,
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/juice-shop-ctf-cli">juice-shop-ctf-cli</a> created
for just this purpose. There&rsquo;s some configuration but I created a <code>ctfd.yaml</code>
file with the various options:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="color:#f92672">ctfFramework</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">CTFd 2.x</span>
<span style="color:#f92672">juiceShopUrl</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com</span>
<span style="color:#f92672">ctfKey</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">Kjrcvim78J5MLR6a7zoaSO73LZJoSWDB</span>
<span style="color:#f92672">countryMapping</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/master/config/fbctf.yml</span>

<span style="color:#f92672">insertHintUrls</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">paid</span>
</code></pre></div><p>After which you can use the <code>juice-shop-ctf-cli</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">npm install -g juice-shop-ctf-cli
juice-shop-ctf --config ctfd.yaml
</code></pre></div><p>This creates a ZIP file which can be uploaded to CTFd&rsquo;s Admin. section.</p>
<h3 id="users--teams">Users &amp; Teams</h3>
<p>CTFd allows for running competitions in either a user- or team-based mode. I
wanted people to be grouped into teams with each person having their own login.</p>
<p>This is where I ran into issues.</p>
<p>The first step was to set up an
<a href="https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords">app. password</a> on my personal Gmail
account. Once configured, I manually created accounts for each of the
participantsâ€”and CTFd kindly forwarded the login details via email to each
individualâ€”and added the two teams.</p>
<p>At which point I couldn&rsquo;t figure out for the life of me how to add users to
those teams. Users can <em>create</em> teams and then pass the details to other users
to join but no one could seemingly join the one&rsquo;s I&rsquo;d created.</p>
<p>After calmly reading the documentation and in no way panicking because it was
lunch time and the competition was only a few hours away, I ended up nuking the
CTFd instance.</p>
<p>And then it got <em>weird</em>â€¦</p>
<p>After recreating the CTFd instance all my users were still there, as were the
flags. But I&rsquo;d removed the containers <em>entirely</em>â€”what was happening?! It turns
out that CTFd keeps everything in local directoryâ€”<code>.data</code>â€”and that was
persisting following the deletion.</p>
<p>So no, I wasn&rsquo;t losing my mind; but I <em>was</em> running out of timeâ€¦</p>
<p>By this point I&rsquo;d pretty much given up. I&rsquo;m sure the documentation covers it
somewhere but I still couldn&rsquo;t put my newly-created users in newly-created
teams. So I cheated. Using some of the credentials I&rsquo;d already minted for two
of the users (one from each team), I created the team using that user. Then
manually logged in as each user and joined the right team.</p>
<h1 id="running-the-event">Running the Event</h1>
<h2 id="beforehand">Beforehand</h2>
<p>On the day of the competition, I made a quick presentation earlier in the day,
hoping to cover the running order and answer any queries (rather than doing
everything 5 minutes before we started):</p>
<pre><code>Start: 16:00
gather teams,
grab beers

Stop: 18:00
present the trophyâ€¦
</code></pre><p>Oh, and set the necessary ground-rules:</p>

<p>For the actual event, the two teams were set up in their own area. I&rsquo;d asked
that one person from each time stream to a nearby television; a separate TV was
used to screen the scoreboardâ€”I&rsquo;d hoped that we&rsquo;d get a few spectators and this
would keep things interesting. Turns out we didâ€”a couple had even joined in and
bagged a flag by the end of the competition.</p>
<p>At 16:00 the competitors grabbed beers, got their heads down and started. The
competition&rsquo;s duration was dictated by the official
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/psypherpunk/playlist/1dZQGTDJMll0B5DBQN3bpp?si=u4GPy9_VRvOv7-OaKk83_A">soundtrack</a>,
running for about 2 hours.</p>
<p>It was interesting to watch the various ways people worked through the hints.
One team immediately created a Teams channel (our internal comms. tool of
choice) to keep track of flags; some coordinated their team-mates, providing
some excellent Google-fu to assist in tracking down some of the more obscure
clues.</p>
<p>But, as the last bars of the soundtrack faded, there could be only one winning
teamâ€”<em>Anomynoush</em>!â€”who could claim the trophy: The Golden Hackerâ„¢.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<p>The VM was budgeted for the month so the following day the Juice Shops were
started back up to allow people to continue catching some of the more elusive
flags.</p>
<p>One thing that had surprised me was the amount of progress made in that first
hour. I&rsquo;d intentionally kept the competition fairly short to avoid anyone
feeling &ldquo;stuck&rdquo;; I should never have doubted them, should I? With that in mind,
there&rsquo;s now the intention to run some smaller, shorter sessions for anyone who
couldn&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>The CTF event was, I think, not only a great way to raise security awareness
within teams but it was <em>fun</em>. The Juice Shop is an ideal format for this sort
of eventâ€”it&rsquo;s wonderfully presented but it&rsquo;s also a <em>genuine</em> application with
<em>genuine</em> vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>I just need to figure out how to top it for the next oneâ€¦</p>
