    <h2 id="why-are-we-here-again">Why Are We Here Again?</h2>
<p>While I outlined my earlier selection of Hugo as the static-site-generator of
choice in a <a href="https://blog.psypherpunk.io/go-down-the-rabbit-hole/">previous post</a>, it's finally time
to admit that Go and I aren't getting on. It's not you, it's me (except it's
totally you.)</p>
<p>And it's more than a little Rust, to be honest.</p>
<p>So, having failed miserably to write anything actually worth publishing (which
does sound like rather a grandious overestimation of my previous posts) in over
eighteen months, it's time to do what we all do and change the underlying
framework so I can hack around and then then
<a href="https://www.theolognion.com/programmer-starts-a-blog-doesnt-write-about-their-static-site-generator-setup-in-the-first-post/">write about it</a>
in a weird, meta fashion.</p>
<h2 id="zola-i-missed-you-sort-of">Zola, I Missed You (Sort of.)</h2>
<p>Back to <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>! My initial choice first time around,
before becoming inexplicably over-optimistic regarding Go, I've been toying with
the shift for far too long so back we went‚Ä¶</p>
<p>It was a, shall we say, <em>inauspicious</em> start.</p>
<p>I followed the
<a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/#first-steps-with-zola"><em>First Steps with Zola</em></a>
documentation to the letter, I swear.</p>
<p>I ran <code>zola init‚Ä¶</code>, created my <code>first.md</code> and <code>second.md</code> blog posts, populated
my <code>templates</code> but‚Ä¶it didn't work.</p>
<p>Running <code>zola serve</code> span up the local webserver, rendering <code>/blogs</code>; visiting
<code>/blogs/first</code> showed the contents of the relevant post perfectly well. But
links to the latter were not appearing in the former.</p>
<p>Specifically, in this bit of the <code>blog.html</code> content:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<code class="language-tera" data-lang="tera"><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">  {% for page in section.pages %}
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{ page.permalink | safe }}&quot;&gt;{{ page.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  {% endfor %}
</span></code></pre>
<p>‚Ä¶the <code>section.pages</code> variable was empty. Displaying the contents with
<code>{{ section.pages }}</code> gave nothing more than a disheartening <code>[]</code>.</p>
<p>I'd love to say I got to the bottom of it but alas, no. After repeated
copy-and-pastes of the documentation my list of blogs remained empty. I'll
probably repeat the exercise and either log a bug or confirm my ineptitude
when I'm done documenting the latter here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúIf at first you don‚Äôt succeed, try, try again. And then give up. There‚Äôs no
sense being a damn fool about it.‚Äù</em><br />
‚ÄìMark Twain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking a different approach and stripping back the metadata in each file, Zola
thankfully started complaining about missing templates and the resulting errors
largely hand-held me through the necessary additions.</p>
<p>The standard templates are documented in the
<a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/templates/overview/#standard-templates">relevant section of the documentation</a>
and, after adding those (rather than those described in the <em>Overview</em>
documentation), voil√†: our section began presenting the expected list of pages.</p>
<p>To implement a site structurally like its predecessor, the only templates
specifically required were <code>index.html</code> (to cover the home-page; functionally
this is a section page but as we've no other sections, the main page fulfils
that role) and <code>page.html</code> (to cover the individual blog posts.)</p>
<h2 id="to-theme-or-not-to-theme">To Theme or Not to Theme?</h2>
<p>I will not use <a href="https://www.getzola.org/themes/zola-386/"><em>ZOLA.386</em></a>; I will not
use <em>ZOLA.386</em>‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I really want to use <em>ZOLA.386</em>.</p>
<p>I'll admit that the <a href="https://www.getzola.org/themes/">themes available for Zola</a>
aren't as many an multifarious as those of Hugo but they nevertheless cover
most simple requirements.</p>
<p>That said, I opted to implement the templates from scratch manually using
<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap 5</a>.
More specifically, using one of the <a href="https://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a>
themes: <a href="https://bootswatch.com/sketchy/"><em>Sketchy</em></a>. Hopefully, that should be
clear to anyone reading this. Unless I've gone and changed my mind again.</p>
<p>Partly, I was intrigued as to how simple it would be (spoilers: quite simple)
and how quickly I could replace the existing site.</p>
<p>I've been discussing the possibility of replacing an existing Wordpress site
elsewhere with a GitHub-hosted static site √† la this one and wanted a feel for
the effort involved (spoilers: not a lot.)</p>
<h2 id="the-actual-hard-work">The Actual Hard Work</h2>
<p>Having decided to implement the templates and now being aware of the specific
files required, the first step was to move the old blog posts into this
directory structure and modify as necessary.</p>
<p>Beyond modifying the necessary metadata in each post's header, there wasn't
actually much more required.</p>
<p>For instance, Hugo favours:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">---
title: &quot;üîì Hack the Shed&quot;
date: 2019-06-19T20:19:51+01:00
description: &quot;Drink all the booze; hack all the things.&quot;
tags: [&quot;security&quot;, &quot;owasp&quot;]
categories: [&quot;security&quot;]
---
</span></code></pre>
<p>‚Ä¶while the same file in Zola looks like:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">+++
title = &quot;üîì Hack the Shed&quot;
date = 2019-06-19
description = &quot;Drink all the booze; hack all the things.&quot;

[taxonomies]
tags = [&quot;security&quot;, &quot;owasp&quot;]
categories = [&quot;security&quot;]
+++
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>[taxonomies]</code> section is perhaps the biggest change: the <code>tags</code> and
<code>categories</code> aren't used by default in Zola and instead need to be configured.
They are, however, arguably more versatile.</p>
<p>They need to be explicitly added in the configuration file, <code>config.toml</code>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml"><span style="color:#bf616a;">taxonomies </span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">= [
    {</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">name </span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">= &quot;</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">tags</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">&quot;, </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">rss </span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">= </span><span style="color:#d08770;">true</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">},
    {</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">name </span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">= &quot;</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">categories</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">&quot;, </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">rss </span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">= </span><span style="color:#d08770;">true</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">},
]
</span></code></pre>
<p>As per Zola's
<a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/taxonomies/">documentation</a>,
they can largely be any grouping needed but the previous taxonomies were left
for now (if it ain't broke‚Ä¶)</p>
<p>So we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a handful of HTML templates files, using Bootstrap.</li>
<li>the previous blog posts from the old site.</li>
<li>errrr‚Ä¶profit?</li>
</ul>
<p>That's actually it. Teething issues with Zola aside, the actual generation of
the final site once the content was migrated and templates written (largely
based on the numerous provided Bootstrap samples), was as simple as
<code>zola build</code>.</p>
<p>Now just to put that newly-generated static content somewhere‚Ä¶</p>
<h2 id="fork-it">Fork It</h2>
<p>The previous mechanism for deployment‚Äîand one I'd hoped to retain in this
version‚Äîwas via use of a
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">Git submodule</a>
referencing an entirely separate, public GitHub repo. to which the static
content can be pushed; the Zola code can therefore be isolated in a private
repo. for tinkering.</p>
<p>Although Zola seemingly recommends submodules for
<a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/github-pages/">themes</a>
it seems the developers are
<a href="https://github.com/getzola/zola/issues/560">not fans</a> for their use as part of
the deployment process. The <code>public</code> folder wherein the generated content is
created by default, is nuked on each <code>zola build</code>.</p>
<p>Arguably for familiarity's sake (and arguably to keep things progressing at a
fair pace), I opted to create a
<a href="https://github.com/PsypherPunk/zola">fork</a> and altered the cleanup stage of
the
<a href="https://github.com/PsypherPunk/zola/blob/master/components/site/src/lib.rs"><code>site</code> sub-crate</a>
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>retain the root (i.e. <code>public</code>) folder.</li>
<li>ignore hidden files (i.e. the <code>.git</code> folder.)</li>
<li>delete all other folders therein as per existing behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thankfully Zola already makes use of
<a href="https://docs.rs/crate/walkdir/2.3.2"><code>walkdir</code></a> so there were zero new
dependencies. And it works.</p>
<p>And look at that, I even got a blog post out of it.</p>
