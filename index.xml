      <description>&amp;ldquo;Has anyone ever participated in a Capture-the-flag style hacking event? Does anyone fancy trying one?&amp;rdquo;
 So, fairly innocuously, began what turned out to be a pretty interesting event.
We recently ran a Capture the Flag (CTF) event at my workplace. For anyone unfamiliar with the concept (which, in all fairness, was the position of many of the participants), there are a few variants of CTF events but the essential premise is this: teams compete to find specific, intended vulnerabilities in a software application.</description>

 Much as we might lament their continued use, passwords are an important part of modern life. A part that seems only to be increasing in ubiquity; as I sit here I can see at least half a dozen devices, from this laptop to my television, that each require an inordinate number of passwords to keep them from turning into little more than novelty paperweights.</description>
